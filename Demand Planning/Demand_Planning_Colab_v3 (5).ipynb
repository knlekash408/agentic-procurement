Seasonal indices are stable because they draw on the full volume of a product type rather than a single item.\n","- **Trend**: Linear trend via weighted least-squares on each SKU's last 12 months (deseasonalized). Recent months weighted up to 12× heavier.\n","- **Base Level**: Exponentially weighted moving average of last 12 months per SKU.\n","- **Manual Growth Override**: Optional annual growth rate applied on top of data-driven trend.\n","\n","## Setup Instructions\n","1.
